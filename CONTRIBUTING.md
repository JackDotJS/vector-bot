  <h1>Contributing Guidelines</h1>

Here you'll find some very basic rules that, if followed, will make development on this bot a lot more streamlined for everyone involved.

1. Comment your code like your life depends on it.
   - If you think your future self might not be able to read it, it needs to be commented.
   - If you used a clever one-liner, explain the process in a comment.
   - If you used some obscure variable name, explain what it means in a comment.
   - If your logic is convoluted, explain each step in a comment.
   
2. DO NOT push massive amounts of work in a single commit. Work on bits a pieces at a time, and commit them separately.
   - This helps with keeping track of what things were added or changed, as well as helping to find bugs if they appear.

3. Make sure your commit messages are clear and concise. This also extends to the commit descriptions, if you use those.
